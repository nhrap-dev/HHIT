# Hurrevac Load Tool
A class to extract, transform and load Hurrevac tropical storm data.
Currently it is a stand alone tool but may be intended as a class in HazPy.
This is a work in progress.

Hurrevac Load Tool

The Hurravac Load Tool loads the Hurrevac Storm data of your choosing to your desktop Hazus database.

To Use

Must have Anaconda 3.X installed. Please read requirements

    Download zip folder of tool from GitHub, unzip

    Double-click "hazus-hurrevac-load-tool.py"

    If you don't have the Hazus Python Library installed you will need to install it. (!INSERT HOW TO DO THAT OR FOLLOW export tools method)

    Select a combination of storm type, basin and year to see a list of available storms. Select the storm from the drop down list.

    Alternatively if you know the Hurrevac storm id, enter it in the entry box.

    Click the 'Load to Hazus' button to load your selected storm from the list or your entered storm id to your Hazus database.
