# Hazus Hurrevac Import Tool
A class to extract, transform and load Hurrevac tropical storm data.
Currently it is a stand alone tool but may be intended as a class in HazPy.
This is a work in progress.

Hurrevac Load Tool

The Hurravac Load Tool loads the Hurrevac Storm data of your choosing to your desktop Hazus database.

## To Use

**Must have Anaconda 3.X installed. Please read requirements**

1. Download zip folder of tool from GitHub, unzip

2. Double-click "hazus-hurrevac-import-tool.py"

3. If you don't have the Hazus Python Library installed you will need to install it. (!INSERT HOW TO DO THAT OR FOLLOW export tools method)

4. Select a combination of storm type, basin and year to see a list of available storms. Select the storm from the drop down list.
