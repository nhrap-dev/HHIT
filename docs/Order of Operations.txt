Important order of operations in storm processing (hurrevac_storm.py):

1 JSON maxWinds(knots) -> MaxWindSpeed(mph and HurrevacVmaxFactor applied)

2 RadiusToHurrWindType (miles) should run before inland adjustment to maxwindspeed.

3 MaxWindSpeed(mph and HurrevacVmaxFactor applied) adjusted by 1.15 if inland=1 (first inland point not adjusted)

4 OptimizeTrack runs after all cacluations are finished and forecast points appended to main dataframe and before loading to sql server.
