Important order of operations in storm processing (hurrevac_storm.py):

1 Process Advisory points

    Calculate fields (TimeStep, etc)
   
        Spatial intersect to determine if inland or not
	   
	    Convert MaxWindSpeed from knots to miles per hour, reduce by HurrevacVmaxFactor from settings
	   
	    RadiusToHurrWindsType (Use the MaxWindSpeed in mph*HurrevacVmaxFactor to determine)
	   
		RadiusToXWinds (34, 50, 64)()

        Fill in intermediate values

		Interim advisory RadiusToXWinds, get previous row's value.

		ZeroOut RadiusToXWinds (based on HurrWindType)

		Inland can not increase in MWS, if current row value is greater than previous row value, set current rows value to previous rows value

		Inland adjustment to MaxWindSpeed (mph and HurrevacVmaxFactor applied) adjusted by 1.15 if inland=1 (first inland point not adjusted)

2 Process Forecast points
 
	Calculate fields (TimeStep, etc)
	
		Spatial intersect to determine if inland or not
		
		Convert MaxWindSpeed from knots to miles per hour, reduce by HurrevacVmaxFactor from settings
		
		RadiusToHurrWindsType (Use the MaxWindSpeed in mph*HurrevacVmaxFactor to determine)
		
		ZeroOut RadiusToXWinds (based on HurrWindType)
		
		Inland can not increase in MWS, if current row value is greater than previous row value, set current rows value to previous rows value

		Inland adjustment to MaxWindSpeed (mph and HurrevacVmaxFactor applied) adjusted by 1.15 if inland=1 (first inland point not adjusted)
		
		Cleanup Forecast data frame before appending to main advisory dataframe

3 Merge Forecast points to Advisory points

4 Threshold checks and data conditiong
	
	Delete rows with 0,0 lat, long values
	
	MaxWindSpeed needs to be 40 or higher
	
	Radius to 34k winds needs to be 30 or higher (where the RadiusToHurrWindsType = T and RadiusTo34KWinds is 0)
	
5 Trim and format advisory dataframe

6 OptimizeTrack runs after all cacluations are finished and forecast points appended to main dataframe and before loading to sql server.


Potential Risk:
-Forecast points are calculated separate from advisory points, risk is that the forecast points may increase in MWS.
