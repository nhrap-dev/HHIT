Important order of operations in storm processing (hurrevac_storm.py):

 Fill in intermediate values

 JSON maxWinds(knots) -> MaxWindSpeed(mph and HurrevacVmaxFactor applied)

 RadiusToHurrWindType (miles) should run before inland adjustment to maxwindspeed.

 RadiusToXWinds (34, 50, 64)

 ZeroOut RadiusToXWinds (based on HurrWindType)

 MaxWindSpeed(mph and HurrevacVmaxFactor applied) adjusted by 1.15 if inland=1 (first inland point not adjusted)

 OptimizeTrack runs after all cacluations are finished and forecast points appended to main dataframe and before loading to sql server.
