Important order of operations in storm processing (hurrevac_storm.py):

 1 Process Advisory points

   Fill in intermediate values

   MaxWindSpeed (convert knots to mph and apply HurrevacVmaxFactor; interim advisories are in knots)

   RadiusToHurrWindType (miles, based on maxwindspeed) should run before inland adjustment to maxwindspeed.

   RadiusToXWinds (34, 50, 64)

   Interim advisory RadiusToXWinds, get previous row's value.

   ZeroOut RadiusToXWinds (based on HurrWindType)

   Inland can not increase in MWS, if current row value is greater than previous row value, set current rows value to previous rows value

   Inland adjustment to MaxWindSpeed (mph and HurrevacVmaxFactor applied) adjusted by 1.15 if inland=1 (first inland point not adjusted)

 2 Process Forecast points

   Merge Forecast points to Advisory points

 3 OptimizeTrack runs after all cacluations are finished and forecast points appended to main dataframe and before loading to sql server.


Potential Risk:
-Forecast points are calculated separate from advisory points, risk is that the forecast points may increase in MWS.
